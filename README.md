### Motivation

Geo-Jumper is a multiplayer fullstack platform game that combines socket.io with a frontend React library. This application is designed to create a unique game experience by matching online users to race to the finish line and be the first to catch the star. This application showcases a multiplayer/multi-level game and persists user data using MongoDB.

In this application, our team configured webpack to compile JavaScript and SASS into a bundle and configured babel to transpile JSX and ES6 to ES5 JavaScript. The application creates and renders React components to the DOM, adds event listeners to React components, and updates React component state.
